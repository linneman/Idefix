Idefix is a very thin webserver for embedded devices. Its main 
purpose it to deliver content statically where most of the user 
interface control logic should be implemented on the client side 
using java script.

The code is implemented in pure ANSI-C and does not necessarily
require a TCP/IP stack to be installed. If TCP/IP is not 
available the http traffic can be routed via a serial line by
byte stuffing ASCII control characteres. The controlling host
is required to route the serial line to a TCP-listening port
e.g. by reusing the code snippets in sockserver.c
