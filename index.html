<h2>What it is?</h2>
<p>Idefix is a very thin webserver for embedded devices. Its main  purpose it to deliver content statically where most of the user interface control logic should be implemented on the client side using java script.</p>

<p>The code is implemented in pure ANSI-C and does not necessarily require a TCP/IP stack to be installed. If TCP/IP is not available the http traffic can be routed via a serial line by byte stuffing ASCII control characteres. The controlling host is required to route the serial line to a TCP-listening port e.g. by reusing the code snippets in sockserver.c</p>

<h2>Source code</h2>
<p>The implementation is exclusively available as source code for unixoid operating systems respectively for a unix emulation environment such as cygwin or mingw under windows. Refer also to the <a href="http://github.com/linneman/Idefix">Idefix project page</a> to down load the latest version. Help or further support is also highly welcome.</p>

<h2>How to install</h2>
<ul>
	<li>tar xvfz linneman-Idefix-e2461ed.tar.gz</li>
	<li>cd linneman-Idefix-e2461ed</li>
	<li>./configure</li>
	<li>make</li>
	<li>sudo make install</li>
</ul>

<p>You can now start the webserver from the command line by the following command:</p>
<code>idefix -p 3000 -r html<code>
<p>Now you should be able to access the following <a href="http://localhost:3000">url on your local machine</a>.
